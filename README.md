# databruce
A SQLite database of Bruce Springsteens career

## To Do:
- Add full writeup
- upload the python scripts to build/update the database
- add some examples of what can be done with the data
- at some point, I'll work on a python script that can manipulate the database for those who aren't familiar with SQL

To easily view the data, you can use the CSV files in the `_csv` folder.

You can also use the [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/), this adds the ability to manipulate the data if you're familiar with SQLite. This app is available for Windows/Mac/Linux
